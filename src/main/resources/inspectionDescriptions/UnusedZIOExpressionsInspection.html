Detects if an ZIO expression is used as a statement, where it's not composed with other expressions, so its value gets ignored:
<pre>
putStrLn("Hello, world")
ZIO.succeed(42)
</pre>
<br/>
Will highlight the expression <code>putStrLn("...")</code>.<br/>
Fix by composing it with the next expression, e.g.:
<pre>putStrLn("Hello world") *>
  ZIO.succeed(42)
</pre>
